Tools and scripts to help with containers technologies such as OpenShift and service meshes like Istio.

The folder minishift has scripts to create a minishift tutorial profile and login to the cluster as admin.

The folder istio has scripts to install Istio, configure Minishift to use it, set the Security Context Contstraints (SCC), and expose the services.
